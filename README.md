 CHURN ANALYTICS AND CUSTOMER INSIGHTS

Project Description: 

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of customer churn behavior for a banking dataset. 
The report is structured into focused sections, enabling stakeholders to identify churn trends, understand key customer demographics, analyze product engagement,
and assess customer value.

The dashboard is designed to help business users:

- Track overall churn performance and spot trends across demographics.
- Drill down into customer segments based on geography, gender, age, and credit score.
- Identify high-risk groups using product usage, balance levels, and activity status.
- Estimate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) and compare it across churned vs active customers.
- Segment customers using an RFM-style framework (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to highlight behavior-based risk patterns.

Advanced visuals include:

- Line charts for churn trend over Age and Tenure  
- Bar and stacked charts for churn by Geography, Gender, and Product Usage  
- Conditional tables to highlight high-balance churners 
- Clustered bars to show churn risk across behavioral segments

The goal of this dashboard is to transform raw customer data into actionable insights that drive better retention strategies and customer engagement decisions.
